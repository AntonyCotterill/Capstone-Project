# Capstone Project - September 2024 - Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence - Imperial College
Optimising and predicting the time of arrival for time critical deliveries

## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
In the delivery business getting goods to the right place at the agreed time is critical. The aim of this project is to build an optimisation model based on historic data and taking into account both travel distance and the weather to help predict delivery times more accuratly. 

## DATA
Working for DHL we have a lot of data however it is also confidential. Therefore, the data used is from Kaggle and is a good representation of the type of data we work with with DHL. The data file is called the Zomato Dataset.csv. It can be found in this repository.

The dataset can also be referenced on kaggle following the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/zomato-delivery-operations-analytics-dataset
